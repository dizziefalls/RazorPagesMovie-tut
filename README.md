# RazorPagesMovie
Getting some experience with C# web development. This follows the [ms docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio). First time with a MVC architecture as well, albeit a page-focused one that's streamlined from the old method from what I understand. Definitely a big change from an unopinionated framework like express. Getting used to visual studio coming from VS code is a hurdle as well. The framework/IDE contains a lot of a helpers and shortcuts and scaffolding solutions. This is all very handy and saves a lot of menial work. However, letting the framework do the work is a educational impedement for me. It seems a strange approach for an entry to the framework. I understand this allows one to see results quickly, but it makes understanding the process difficult. Some of this work is seemingly necessary due to the somewhat cryptic results it produces to facilitate a well connected system. That being said, the point of the built-in ORM is to simplify db interaction, and it performs this quite capably. I still find the UI and process abtruse, but hopefully that will clear up with exposure. In any case, this is a good first step, and I'll keep with it.
